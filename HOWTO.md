# How to play

The rules of the game are simple-
* Place words on the board using the tiles that are present in your rack.
* The first word of the game should cover the center tile of the board.
* Make sure that the word you place connects with at least one tile that is already on the board.
* Tiles can be placed left to right or top to bottom, one after the other.
